                  eleven thousand years he has been asleep. <br />
                  Inside his mouth lies a forgotten keep, <br />
                  within it's deepest reach is a golden box <br />
                  all you need to do to open it is to give it props.<br />
                  But you can't. <br />
                  What do you need to do to open contents of the box? <br />
